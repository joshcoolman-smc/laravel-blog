# Your Basic Blog (AI Generated)
 **All code in this project was generated through AI**, specifically using the Cline AI assistant, with human guidance and iteration. What makes this interesting:

- Zero manual code writing - all code was generated through AI-human collaboration
- The developer had never used Laravel or Vue before this project
- No framework documentation was consulted during development
- All architecture decisions and implementations were handled by AI with human feedback

## Features

- Modern, responsive UI
- Content management system
- Authentication system (mock by default)
- File upload capabilities (mock by default)
- Sample blog posts pre-loaded
- Easy local development with zero configuration
- AI-generated codebase with clean architecture

## Quick Start

1. Clone the repository
2. Run setup commands:
```bash
# Install PHP dependencies
composer install

# Install Node dependencies
npm install

# Copy environment file
cp .env.example .env

# Generate application key
php artisan key:generate

# Create SQLite database
touch database/database.sqlite

# Run migrations
php artisan migrate

# Start Laravel server (in one terminal)
php artisan serve

# Start Vite dev server (in another terminal)
npm run dev
```

3. Visit `http://localhost:8000` in your browser

## Development

By default, the application runs in mock mode with sample data:

- Sample blog posts are pre-loaded
- Login with any email/password combination (e.g., admin@example.com / any-password)
- File uploads are simulated
- No external services required

### Using Supabase (Optional)

To use Supabase instead of mock data:

1. Create a new Supabase project at https://supabase.com

2. Set up the database schema:
   - Go to your Supabase project's SQL editor
   - Copy the contents of `database/supabase/schema.sql`
   - Run the SQL commands to create:
     - Content table with RLS policies
     - Storage bucket for content images
     - Required storage policies

3. Configure your environment:
   ```
   # Update .env file
   USE_MOCK_REPOSITORIES=false
   VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your-project-url
   VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key
   ```

4. Enable authentication:
   - Go to Authentication settings in your Supabase dashboard
   - Enable Email provider under Authentication > Providers
   - Create a user account through the Auth UI or SQL editor

The schema includes:
- Content management with title, description, content, and image fields
- Row Level Security (RLS) policies for user-specific content
- Public storage bucket for content images
- Storage policies for authenticated image uploads

### AI Writer Feature (Optional)

The blog includes an AI-powered content generation feature that leverages OpenAI's GPT model to assist in content creation. This feature demonstrates modern AI integration patterns and structured output handling.

#### Technical Implementation

1. Backend Architecture:
   - Structured JSON output format for consistent content generation
   - Title optimization (50-60 characters) with SEO considerations
   - Meta description generation (150-160 characters) for better search results
   - Content formatting with proper HTML structure
   - System prompts designed for blog-specific content
   - Error handling and logging for AI interactions

2. Frontend Integration:
   - Reactive Vue.js components with real-time updates
   - Modular popup component for AI interaction
   - Dark mode support for AI interface
   - Progressive enhancement (UI only shows when feature is enabled)

3. Content Generation Modes:
   - New Content Generation: Creates complete articles from prompts
   - Content Enhancement: Uses existing text as a foundation
   - Metadata Generation: Optional title and description generation
   - Length Control: Targets 3-5 minute read times (750-1250 words)

#### Setup Instructions

1. Enable the feature:
   ```
   # Update .env file
   AI_WRITER=true
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key
   ```

2. Get an OpenAI API key:
   - Sign up at https://platform.openai.com
   - Create an API key in your account settings
   - Copy the key to your .env file

#### Usage Features

1. Content Generation:
   - Click the sparkles âœ¨ AI Assistant button in the editor toolbar
